# Automation Testing with Selenium and TestNG

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate automated testing using Selenium WebDriver in combination with TestNG and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The goal is to create a maintainable and scalable framework for automated web application testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For automating web application testing.
- **TestNG**: A testing framework inspired by JUnit, designed for test configuration and reporting.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: A design pattern that enhances test maintenance and reduces code duplication by creating an object repository for web elements.
